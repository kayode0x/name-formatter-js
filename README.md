# name-formatter
Format a name in the sense that only the first letter of the name is in upper case and the other letters are in lower case.

It has an input validation. Accepts only Alphabets, also checks for empty spaces and removes them.

It can be refactored to suit your needs, just add it to where ever you need it.
